# zeet_project (Resource)

The `zeet_project` resource manages Zeet projects, categorized into two types based on deployment strategies: Container-based and Workflow-based projects.

**Container-based Projects**: The `container` attribute defines deployment specifications for Docker containers, including the source repository, build settings, Kubernetes deployment configuration, and container-specific workflows. This setup suits service or job containers deployable directly to Kubernetes clusters.

**Workflow-based Projects**: The `workflow` and `deploys` attributes are for projects deploying via Helm charts, Kubernetes manifests, or using Terraform for infrastructure as code. `workflow` outlines the deployment's sequence of operations, such as build and deploy steps, while `deploys` specifies the deployment configuration, including driver execution steps.

Projects must use one of these configurations without combining them within the same project. It's possible to define multiple projects with different configurations to create more complex architectures.
